      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web
        developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications,
        servers, and even games. It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS,
        complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user
        interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript’s widespread applications in web, mobile app, and game
        development make it a valuable language to learn.

      <h3>What is JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a scripting language for creating dynamic web page
        content. It creates elements for improving site visitors’ interaction
        with web pages, such as dropdown menus, animated graphics, and dynamic
        background colors.

      <h3>What is JavaScript used for?</h3>

        <span> Web and mobile apps:</span>
        The development of JavaScript frameworks,
        consisting of JavaScript code libraries, allows developers to use
        pre-written JavaScript code in their projects. It saves them time and
        effort from having to code programming features from scratch. Each
        JavaScript framework has features that aim to simplify the development
        and debugging process. For example, front-end JavaScript frameworks like
        jQuery and ReactJS improve design efficiency. They allow developers to
        reuse and update code components without affecting each other, function
        or value-wise. Meanwhile, mobile application development frameworks such
        as Cordova and Titanium make it possible to create native or hybrid
        applications. The implementation of JavaScript code in Node.js also
        plays an important role in web development. Node.js can reduce server
        response time due to its single-threaded nature and non-blocking
        architecture and omit delays. Node.js is also lightweight enough to
        serve as a scalable tool for microservices, allowing you to develop a
        single app comprising small services with individual processes.
